        <h1>What is a carbon footprint calculator?</h1>
<p>The carbon foot print calculator is a tool that uses data on consumption behavior NEWS CLIMATE CHANGE ABOUT US Donate
The carbon footprint calculator is a tool that uses data on consumption behavior
and lifestyle to understand what your sources of carbon emissions are.</p>
<p >The idea is that you have a dimension, depending on your habits, on the amount of
carbon you emit into the atmosphere through your choices in food,
transportation and other aspects of everyday life.</p>
    </div>
<div style="background-color: darkorange; color: black;">
<h1>How is the carbon footprint calculated?</h1>

<p>As carbon is one of the gasses of greatest concern when it comes to climate change, there are studies available with the average or exact
measurement of each activity we usually perform in our day, such as taking the car to go to work, for example.</p>
<p>In this way, an individual's carbon footprint is calculated based on all of their choices and the intensity of this emission, in order to
understand what their carbon footprint is projected during the year, the decade or throughout their lifetime.</p>
</div>
<div style="background-color: black; color: white;">
<h1>Does carbon affect climate change?</h1>
<p>Carbon greatly affects climate change. It is one of the main greenhouse gasses, along with methane, another major concern for scientists.</p>
        <p>Greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide (CO2) have the power to trap radiation from the sun. So the more gasses like this we have in the
            atmosphere, the hotter it tends to get (hence the name greenhouse effect).</p>
        <p>If we could achieve total zero carbon emissions, we could simply halt the rapid advance of global warming. As this would be impossible, it is
            necessary to zero the carbon footprint in sectors where we have a choice, such as the generation of electricity, fuel or the generation of
            waste</p>

    <h1>How can I decrease my carbon footprint?</h1>
    <p>In the desire to help the planet heal itself, many people are starting to look for solutions in their lives to reduce their carbon footprint.
        Swap the car for public transport, or app cars. Turn off the lights early. Eat less meat...</p>
        <p>All this is valid. If that's what you believe, invest in this project. However, you have to be realistic. You are just one person out of about 8
        billion human beings. This is not a war that can be won individually.</p>
        <p>When it comes to climate change, you need to make allies and join groups that can make a difference on a global scale. The Hourglass
        project is here to help with that</p>
